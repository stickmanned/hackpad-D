# hackpad :D
simple macropad based on the Hack Club Hackpad.

This is a simple, straightforward 4 switch macro pad with rgb leds called the hackpad :D. The hackpad :D is very happy and loves getting pressed on by the user using the hackpad :D. Using KMK firmware, hackpad :D is brought to life! <img width="1206" height="579" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4eb3373-93e2-49ad-999e-7d6dc0fc0545" />
